### how to start server

```
$ npm i
$ npm run server
```

### how to start client

```
$ cd client
$ npm i
$ npm run dev
```

### basic workflow

1. create a few wallets
2. note the private key of one wallet from the server log or front end
3. grab the address either from the server log or the front end
4. go to /send and enter the appropriate inputs to start a transaction

### todo

1. some validation
2. balance checking
3. persistence
4. use of vrs signatures instead of sending private key
